### prob_catch.py
This is a Python 3 program that calculates the probability of catching a pokemon with user-input
* iv
* ev
* pokemon species
* pokemon level
* status condition
* hp value
* pokeball type

It outputs the probability of catching that pokemon with those given parameters, as well as how many of the inputted pokeball type it will take on average to capture it.


### sim_catch.py 
This is a Python 3 program that simulates catching a pokemon with random values for each parameter (iv, ev, hp, level, pokemon, pokeball, status) and writes each simulation result (along with the inputted parameters) to a csv file.
