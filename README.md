# Pokemon Catcher Simulator

### prob_catch.py
This is a Python 3 program that calculates the probability of catching a pokemon with user-input
-pokemon species
-pokemon level
-status condition
-hp value
-pokeball being thrown

It outputs the probability of catching that pokemon with those given parameters, as well as how many of the inputted pokeball type it will take on average to capture it.


### sim_catch.py [WIP]
This is a Python 3 program that simulates catching a pokemon with user-input and writes each simulation result to a csv file.
